<body>
    <p>This is an example of a paragraph in HTML. Notice how it makes the text easier to read.</p>
    <p>I <strong>strongly</strong> recommend using <em>emphasis</em> tags like <strong>strong</strong> and <em>em</em> to highlight important text. Also, don't forget about <sub>subscript</sub> and <sup>superscript</sup> for details like H<sub>2</sub>o and E=mc<sup>2</sup>.</p>
    <p>Special characters like &amp;, &lt;, &gt; and &nbsp; are essential for web development. Remember to use &copy; or &reg; for copyright or registered symbols, respectively.</p>
